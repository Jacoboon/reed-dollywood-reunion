      <h2>When Are We Going?</h2>
      <p>
        We are aiming for late spring during Dollywood's Flower &amp; Food Festival (typically late April
        through early June).
      </p>
      <p>Target window:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Last weekend of April</strong></li>
        <li><strong>First one or two weekends of May</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We will avoid holiday weekends like Memorial Day when prices and crowds spike. Dates are flexible and
        will be finalized after we see everyone's RSVPs.
      </p>

      <p>The current plan is simple:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>3 nights</strong> total</li>
        <li><strong>2 days</strong> at Dollywood</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Proposed structure</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Night 1:</strong> Arrivals, easy dinner, catching up, old stories, and photos.</li>
        <li><strong>Day 1 - Dollywood:</strong> Rides, shows, Flower &amp; Food Festival, exploring together.</li>
        <li><strong>Day 2 - Dollywood or Free Day:</strong> Finish favorites, or mix Dollywood with Pigeon Forge activities or downtime.</li>
        <li><strong>Morning 4:</strong> Big breakfast together, last photos, hugs, and travel home.</li>

      <h2>Where Will We Stay?</h2>
      <p>Three options to keep us together, comfortable, and within budget.</p>
      <div class="cards">
        <article class="card">
          <h3>A. Shared Cabin (Preferred)</h3>
          <p>Large cabin near Pigeon Forge for a big chunk of the family.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>3-4 bedroom cabins sleeping about 8-12 people</li>
            <li>Roughly $200-$400 per night before tax/fees</li>
            <li>Splitting across a full cabin keeps per-person lodging low</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Benefits: one hub to hang out, kitchen for shared meals, cozy living room/porch, maybe a hot tub or game room. The organizer plans to cover the cabin cost if possible.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>B. Hotels</h3>
          <p>If we split into nearby hotel rooms instead:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mid-range rooms often run around $100-$150 per night in spring weekends</li>
            <li>Each household books its own room near the group</li>
            <li>Private space and easy booking, but less "all together" time</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>C. Dollywood Resorts</h3>
          <p>Dollywood's DreamMore Resort &amp; Spa and similar options:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Resort perks like shuttles and parking benefits</li>
            <li>More themed and higher-end than standard hotels</li>
            <li>Great if a smaller group wants a destination feel; cabins are usually more cost-effective for a large group</li>

      <h2>The Invitation (Why This Matters)</h2>
      <p>
        This started as a way to turn "remember when we were all together?" into "remember when we met up at
        Dollywood and did it again?" We used to gather often, but life got busy and most connections are quick calls or texts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reunion is a chance to honor old memories, bring the younger generation into the mix, and make new stories in a special place. Tone is warm, low-pressure, and open to friends, partners, and bonus family. If you love someone in the Reed circle, you're welcome.

        <li><strong>Think about dates</strong>—late April or early May weekends that are easiest for you.</li>
        <li><strong>Consider your travel plan</strong> (drive time, carpooling).</li>
        <li><strong>Share must-haves</strong> like accessibility, dietary needs, or mobility concerns.</li>
        <li><strong>Spread the word</strong> to partners, kids, and close friends who feel like family.</li>
