# Reed Family Reunion @ Dollywood

Welcome to the planning hub for a Reed family (and friends) reunion at Dollywood in late spring. This page captures the current plan, budget expectations, and what we need from each household to make it happen.

---

## 1. When Are We Going?

We’re aiming for **late spring**, during Dollywood’s **Flower & Food Festival** (typically late April through early June).

To balance weather, crowds, and prices, our target window is:

- **Last weekend of April**
- Or the **first one or two weekends of May**

We will avoid holiday weekends like **Memorial Day**, when prices and crowds tend to spike.

These dates are flexible and will be finalized based on everyone’s RSVPs.

---

## 2. How Long Are We Staying?

The current plan is:

- **3 nights** total
- **2 days** at Dollywood

Proposed structure:

- **Night 1**  
  Everyone arrives, settles into the cabin or hotel, easy dinner, catching up, old stories, and photos.

- **Day 1** – Dollywood  
  First full park day: rides, shows, the Flower & Food Festival, and exploring together.

- **Day 2** – Dollywood or Free Day  
  Second park day (finishing favorites and missed attractions), or a mix of Dollywood, Pigeon Forge activities, or just relaxing.

- **Morning 4**  
  Big breakfast together, a few last photos, then everyone heads home.

---

## 3. Where Will We Stay?

There are three main lodging options. The goal is to pick one that keeps us together, comfortable, and within budget.

### A. Shared Cabin (Preferred)

The favorite option is to rent a **large cabin** near Pigeon Forge that can hold a big chunk of the family under one roof.

Typical cabins in the area:

- **3–4 bedroom cabins** that sleep around **8–12 people**
- Approximate base range (before tax/fees):  
  - Around **$200–$400 per night** depending on size and amenities
- Splitting that across a full cabin of 8–12 people makes the **per-person cost for lodging very reasonable** for the whole stay.

Benefits:

- Everyone hangs out in one central space
- Kitchen for shared meals
- Living room, porch, maybe a hot tub or game room
- Super social and nostalgic (“Uncle Steve’s living room, but in the mountains”)

The current idea is that the **organizer covers the cabin cost** (details below), so everyone else mostly focuses on travel, tickets, and food.

### B. Hotels

If we decide on hotels instead:

- Typical mid-range Pigeon Forge rooms in spring weekends can run roughly **$100–$150 per night**.
- Families would book their own rooms near each other.

Pros:

- Each household gets its own private space.
- Easy booking and cancellation.

Cons:

- Less “all together, all the time” vibe.
- Everyone is spread across multiple rooms and locations.

### C. Dollywood Resorts

Dollywood has official resorts such as **Dollywood’s DreamMore Resort & Spa** and others:

- More themed, “destination-style” lodging.
- Extra perks like park shuttle and parking benefits.

These are usually more per night than a standard hotel and are best if a smaller group wants a higher-end stay. For a large group, cabins are typically more cost-effective.

## 4. Park Tickets & Costs

These numbers are **approximate** and may shift slightly by the time we book, but they’re good for planning.

### Tickets (Per Person, After Tax, Approximate)

For adults (ages 18–61):

- **1-Day Adult Ticket**  
  Around **$100–$105 per person**
- **2-Day Adult Ticket**  
  Around **$130–$140 per person**

Kids and seniors:

- **Kids (roughly 4–9)** and **seniors (62+)** are usually **somewhat cheaper** than adult prices.
- We will share more precise numbers once we lock in the actual booking window, but you can safely assume:
  - Kids and seniors are a little below adult pricing.

For budgeting, you can use this rough guide:

- Adults:
  - 1 day: about $100 each
  - 2 days: about $135 each
- Kids:
  - 1 day: about $90 each
  - 2 days: about $120 each
- Seniors:
  - 1 day: about $95 each
  - 2 days: about $125 each

### Group Discounts

If we have enough people (typically **15+** going on the same day):

- Dollywood offers **group rates**, sometimes with noticeable savings per ticket.
- Group packages can also include perks like a **free ticket for every so many paid tickets**.

Once we have RSVPs, we can contact Dollywood group sales and see how much we can save.

### Parking

- **Standard parking** is generally around **$25 per car per day**.
- A rough group estimate:
  - 3 cars for 2 days would be about **$150** in total parking.

Carpooling will help keep this cost lower per person.

### Food Inside Dollywood

Dollywood food can be surprisingly solid and filling, but like any theme park, it adds up.

Good planning numbers:

- **Plan on about $40–$50 per person per day** for:
  - 2 meals in the park
  - Snacks (funnel cakes, cinnamon bread, etc.)

This number can go down if you:

- Eat a big breakfast at the cabin/hotel first.
- Share large dishes.
- Stick mostly to quick-service spots.

## 5. One Special Splurge: Dolly Parton’s Stampede

One optional highlight is **Dolly Parton’s Stampede** in Pigeon Forge:

- It’s a dinner show with live horses, music, and a full four-course meal.
- Typical ticket range:
  - Around **$70+ per adult** before tax
  - Around **$35+ per child** before tax

The idea is:

- The organizer may treat a few key family members (for example, elders or VIPs) to this show.
- Other folks can join if they want to purchase their own tickets.

This is not required to enjoy the reunion, but it’s a fun extra outing if we want one big “evening spectacle.”

---

## 6. How the Budget Works

The organizer is working with two budget levels:

- A **comfortable budget** around **$2,000**
- A **maximum stretch budget** around **$4,000**

These numbers drive how much can be covered centrally vs. what each household will cover.

### Option A – Shared Costs, Everyone Chips In (Most Likely)

Under this option, the organizer would aim to:

- Pay for the **shared cabin** for 3 nights (so nobody has to worry about the lodging bill).
- Cover their own tickets, food, and some shared groceries.
- Possibly treat a subset of family members to **Dolly Parton’s Stampede**.

Everyone else:

- Pays for:
  - Their own **travel** (driving, gas, etc.)
  - Their own **park tickets** (1 or 2 days)
  - Their own **food** inside the park
- May optionally chip in a small amount for shared groceries at the cabin (breakfasts, snacks, at least one shared dinner).

This option keeps the organizer in the “comfortable” range and gives every household a clear, reasonable number to plan for.

### Option B – Maximum Treat, Organizer Covers Almost Everything

If it’s feasible and the attendance numbers line up, the stretch goal option is:

- Organizer covers:
  - **Cabin for everyone**
  - **Most or all park tickets**
  - **A large chunk of food**
  - **Parking**
  - **A handful of Stampede tickets**

Everyone else:

- Mainly covers their own travel and any extra personal spending (souvenirs, additional attractions, etc.).

This uses nearly the full stretch budget and depends heavily on how many people are coming. It will be decided after seeing RSVP numbers.

Regardless of which option ends up being used, the goal is to:

- Make the trip **affordable and predictable** for each household.
- Be transparent about what is covered vs. what isn’t.

## 7. Sample Weekend Plan

Here is a draft of how the reunion weekend might flow. Exact times and details will be flexible.

### Night 1 – Arrival & Memory Night

- Everyone arrives at the cabin/hotel.
- Simple shared dinner (chili, pasta, or pizza).
- Spread out:
  - Old photo albums
  - Pictures of parents, grandparents, and family events
- “Story circle” where each person shares a favorite memory or story.

### Day 1 – Dollywood: Flowers, Food, and Fun

- Head to Dollywood in the morning.
- Take a **group photo** near the main park entrance or at a scenic spot.
- Spend the morning exploring:
  - Flower & Food Festival displays
  - Rides and roller coasters for thrill-seekers
  - Shows and shops for folks who like a slower pace
- Lunch together at a pre-chosen spot.
- Afternoon: split into mini-groups based on interests.
- Evening: meet up to watch a show, listen to music, or walk the park at sunset.

### Day 2 – Second Park Day or Mix & Match

Possible paths:

- **Option 1: Second full Dollywood day**
  - Go back to favorite rides and shows.
  - Hit sections of the park missed on Day 1.

- **Option 2: Half park, half Pigeon Forge**
  - Some might do only a half-day in the park.
  - Others can explore local attractions: mini-golf, outlets, scenic drives, etc.

In the evening:

- Potential group outing to **Dolly Parton’s Stampede** for those attending.
- Others hang out at the cabin, play games, or relax.

### Morning 4 – Big Breakfast & Goodbyes

- Make a big group breakfast (pancakes, eggs, biscuits, etc.).
- Final family photos–cabin porch, driveway, or a scenic overlook.
- Hugs and goodbyes as everyone hits the road.

## 8. The Invitation (Why This Matters)

This whole idea comes from wanting to turn “remember when we used to all be together?” into “remember when we met up at Dollywood and did it again?”

Core points behind the invitation:

- Our family used to gather regularly for holidays and big moments.
- Life got busy, and we mostly see each other through quick calls, texts, or social media.
- We still care deeply about each other, and we’re all getting older.
- This reunion is a way to:
  - Honor those memories and the people we’ve lost.
  - Introduce the younger generation to the extended family.
  - Build new stories in a special place.

The preferred tone of the invitation is:

- Warm
- Low-pressure
- Clear about expectations and costs
- Open to friends, partners, and “bonus family”

If you love someone in the Reed circle, you’re welcome.

## 9. What You Can Do Right Now

To help plan and keep everything fair and realistic, each household can:

1. **Fill out the RSVP form**
   - How many people you might bring (adults, kids, seniors)
   - Your **comfortable budget** and **maximum budget**
   - Preferred lodging style (shared cabin, hotel, or flexible)
   - How many park days you’re interested in

2. **Think about possible dates**
   - Late April or early May weekends that are easiest for you to travel.

3. **Consider your travel plan**
   - How far a drive it is for you
   - Whether you might carpool with someone

4. **Share any must-haves**
   - Specific accessibility needs
   - Dietary requirements
   - Any mobility concerns (walking distances, stairs, etc.)

5. **Spread the word**
   - Invite partners, kids, and close friends who feel like family.

Once we collect everyone’s info:

- We’ll lock in a specific weekend.
- We’ll reserve the cabin or main lodging.
- We’ll confirm approximate per-household costs and ticket choices.
- We’ll send out final details well in advance so everyone has time to plan.

This reunion only works if everyone has a good sense of the plan and feels comfortable with their piece of the budget. Your RSVP and honest input will make that possible.
